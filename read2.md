# BASICS OF HTML , CSS & JS
Ch. 2: "TEXT"
## HEADINGS
- `<h1>`
- `<h2>`
- `<h3>`
- `<h4>`
- `<h5>`
- `<h6>`
## PARAGRAPHS
- `<p>`
## BOLD & ITALIC

Break = `<br>`

*Code views* show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter the new code yourself.

Blockquote = `<blockquote>`

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

## CH. 10 "Introducing CSS"
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

# JAVASCRIPT
CH. 2 "Basic JavaScript Instructions"
- a script is made up of a series of statements.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces used in the script.
Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related info.
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Strings (text)
  - Boolean (true or false)
- Expressions evaluate into a single value
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value
- Concatonation = +

___
Decisions = using the results of evaluations, you can decide what path your script should go down.

Loops = occasion where you want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly
