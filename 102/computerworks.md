# HOW COMPUTERS WORK
___________
## How Information is Represented Using Electricity
* Computers manipulate information.
* Computers take input, store information, process that data, then output it.
#### ALGORITHM = a series of commands.
----
#### Binary & Data
* Computers have trasnistors that read only binary code.
* Binary is 1's & 0's.

Smallest piece of information a computer can store is a *bit*.

THE BINARY # SYSTEM

ex.)
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 = 102

1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

##### 32 Wires store from 0-4 Billion

[The ASCII Code](http://www.asciitable.com) or (The American Standard Code for Information Interchange) shows how text is represented in binary.

#### PIXELS display RGB (Red, Green, Blue) to make any color on a screen.

## How Computers Use Circuits
CIRCUITS use signals to combine binary input to create an output.

LOGIC GATES
* and/nand
* not/nor
* or/xor

ADDER is a circuit that takes in 2 bits. 

All a computer is, is a bunch of circuits solving complex computations.

_____

## The 4 Parts of a Computer
1. Memory (Where the computer stores info)
2. CPU (Central Processing Unit) 
3. Input (Binary)
4. Output (Anything we can imagine)

#### RUSSELL KIRCSH is the creator of the pixel.

## How Software Controls Hardware
## HARD VS. SOFT

Hardware- The physical components that make up a computer.

Software- The product or creation that the computer. Tells the CPU what to do.

OPERATING SYSTEM (From Mr. Windows himself, Bill Gates)
* The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
