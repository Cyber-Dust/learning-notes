# HTML
## Introduction
HTML=HyperText Markup Language

People access websites using software called a **web browser**

**web servers** are special computers that host the webiste

**web hosting** are companies that charge a fee to host someones website

### CMS - Content Management System

ISP = Internet Service Provider

DNS = Domain Name System
- created at USC (fun fact: USC was one of the first nodes for ARPANET)



## Ch. 1: Structure
* HTML Pages are text documents

* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## Ch. 8: Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
`<!-- and -->` markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

## Ch. 17: HTML5 Layout

* new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple `<div>` elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

## Ch. 18: Process & Design

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

# JAVASCRIPT
## Introduction
JavaScript makes websites more interative by:
- Accessing and modifying the content 
- responds to what the user does

JavaScript is essentially, the language of the web.

JS | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | JS
- Access 
- Modify
- Program
- React

## Ch. 1: The ABC of Programming

# A
*what is a script and how do I create one?*
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Computers solves problems progmatically
- Think like a computer and break it down
  - Define the goal
  - Design the script
  - Code each step
# B
*how do computers fit in with the world around them?*
- Computers create models of the world using data
- Each element creates its own node
- to amke pages interactive , you write code that uses the browsers model of the webpage
# C
*how do I write a script for a webpage?*
- Keep JS code in its own JS file. = .js extension
- `<script>` element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript File
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, becuase the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
