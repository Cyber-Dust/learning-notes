# Forms and Events
# HTML
## CH. 7
- `<form>` element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.
## CH. 14

- List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.
